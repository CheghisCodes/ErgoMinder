## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Refreshing light green (#A7D1AB) to evoke feelings of nature and well-being. This color's hue aligns with nature and tranquility. Its lightness ensures a calming and unobtrusive presence, while its moderate saturation keeps it from being dull.
- Background color: Very light desaturated green (#F0F4EF) to ensure a gentle and calming backdrop.
- Accent color: Calming light blue (#98B4D4) to suggest focus and tranquility. Being analogous to the primary color, it provides harmony, while being brighter and less saturated provides enough contrast for visual interest.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif offering a blend of modernity with a touch of warmth and readability, ideal for both headlines and body text.
- Simple, clean icons representing each type of break/activity (eye icon, water droplet, stretching figure).
- Clean, uncluttered layout with clear sections for each type of reminder.
- Subtle animations for reminders and notifications to catch the user's attention without being intrusive.
